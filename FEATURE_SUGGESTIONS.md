## ðŸš€ My Top 3 Recommendations

Based on your business needs, I suggest implementing these first:

### 1. WhatsApp Floating Widget (30 minutes)

**Why:** Immediate impact on customer contact
**Implementation:** Simple floating button with smart messaging

### 2. Customer Reviews System (2-3 hours)

**Why:** Builds trust and social proof
**Implementation:** Display existing reviews + submission form

### 3. Multi-language Support (4-5 hours)

**Why:** Serves both French locals and international tourists
**Implementation:** Expand existing translation system

Would you like me to implement any of these features? I'd recommend starting with the WhatsApp floating widget since it's quick and will immediately improve customer engagement!
